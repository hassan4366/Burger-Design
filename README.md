# Burger-Design
<p>I recently worked on a website interface concept for a modern burger restaurant called Burger Bun. The focus was on clean layout, engaging visuals, and a smooth user experience.

âœ… Highlights of the design:

Hero section with bold headlines and strong CTA buttons

Organized content blocks for menu categories (Burgers, Snacks, Beverages)

High-quality food imagery and clear information hierarchy

ðŸ’¡ The goal: To deliver a user-friendly, visually appealing restaurant website that drives orders and bookings.

Would love your feedback or thoughts!</p>
